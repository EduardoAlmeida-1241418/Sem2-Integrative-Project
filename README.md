This repository contains the development of the Integrative Project for the second semester of the 2024/25 academic year. The project aims to create an IT solution that simulates the operation of railway networks. It’s developed within the scope of the following courses:
 
 **・ESOFT** – Software Engineering
 
 **・PPROG** – Programming Paradigms
 
 **・MATCP** – Computational Mathematics
 
 **・MDISC** – Discrete Mathematics
 
 **・LAPR2** – Laboratory Project II
 
 
 The solution is divided into two main components:
 
 1. **Map and Scenario Editor** – Allows the creation of maps with cities and industries and the definition of scenarios with historical and technological context.
 
 2. **Simulation Tool** – Enables the management of railway networks, including stations, trains, routes, and cargo transportation, with tools for performance analysis and network connectivity evaluation.
